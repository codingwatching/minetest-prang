[![ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/luk3yx/prang/shields/downloads/)](https://content.minetest.net/packages/luk3yx/prang/)

An unofficial port of
[PRANG!](https://atomicshrimp.com/post/2020/01/10/Play-PRANG!) to Minetest.

There are instructions on how to play inside the game.

Requires 5.4.0+ servers, however it should work with clients down to 5.0.0
(although it will send more HUD updates to clients older than 5.2.0).

If you don't see a "FPS" counter at the top-left corner of the game, you may
need to zoom out to be able to see the entire game. Minetest doesn't provide an
API to get the window resolution from clients so an automatic zoom feature
isn't possible at the moment.

## Download

You can install PRANG! using Minetest's "browse online content" feature.
